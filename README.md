# Convolve

## A PAN-IIT competition involving data analytics.

## Introduction
We were suppose to select 20 actual features from a list of 40 features of which other 20 were randomly generated.
The project was done in a team of 4 on collaborator mode in `Google Colab`.

## My Contribution
- Using several general tests to find out the 20 best features.
    - This involved using inbuilt fucntions in tensorflow and sklearn libraries.
    - The result was then combined to reach the final value.
- Making the report and writing the comments at various part of the code.
